# virtual_dot_plotter

simple Arduino + Processing system to drive an Etch-a-Sketch like screen interaction from two potentiometers

Use two potentiometers (i.e. volume knobs) to operate an Etch-a-sketch like simple drawing program on a computer screen.

The pictures drawn look a bit like this beautiful lemon:
